    request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for
    large responses.  The chunk size is the number of bytes it should
    read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
    returned as decoding can take place.

    chunk_size must be of type int or None. A value of None will
    function differently depending on the value of `stream`.
    stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
    chunks are received. If stream=False, data is returned as
    a single chunk.

    If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best
    available encoding based on the response.
